    "## 📊 Project Overview: Demographic Data Analyzer\n",
    "\n",
    "This project involves analyzing demographic data from the 1994 U.S. Census using the **Pandas** library. The dataset contains information such as age, education, occupation, hours worked per week, and income level.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "To extract meaningful statistics and insights from the dataset by answering specific demographic questions, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    " How many individuals belong to each race category?\n",
    " What is the average age of men?\n",
    " What percentage of people have a Bachelor's degree?\n",
    " What percentage of individuals with advanced education earn more than $50K?\n",
    " What is the minimum number of hours people work per week, and how many of them earn less than $50K?\n",
    " Which country has the highest percentage of high earners?\n",
    " What is the most popular occupation for high earners in India?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧰 Tools Used\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python\n",
    "- Pandas\n",
    "- Jupyter Notebook (for code, analysis, and documentation)\n",
